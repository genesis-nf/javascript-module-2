/*

Think of 5 different real world "things" that you 
can describe with a JavaScript object

Assign each of them to a separate variable


For example:
var car = {
    brand: "Seat",
    model: "Arona",
    color: "white",
    horsepower: 115,
    doors: 5
};

*/

var  house = {
    color: "Green",
    bedRooms: 4,
    kitchen: 2,
    floors: 3,
};

var hair = {
    color: "Blond",
    long: 5,
    court: "FRANCESA CLARA",
};

var car ={
    body: "Large SUV.",
    doors: 5,
    seats: 5,
    boot: 580 "l",
    power: 330 - 580 "hp",
    consumption: 15.9 "l / 100km",
};
